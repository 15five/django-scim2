CHANGE LOG
==========

0.13.0
------
- Added validation methods to adapters

0.12.8
------
- Upgrade dependency: scim2-filter-parser -> 0.2.3 to fix tokenization error

0.12.7
------
- Refactor location of ATTR_MAP, placed in filters.py
- Fixed NameError
- Add testing around complex queries
- Upgrade dependency: scim2-filter-parser -> 0.2.2

0.12.6
------
- Refactor ComplexAttrPaths to use custom class

  This changes the API for PATCH handlers.
  Handlers will take a 3-tuple as before and now, additionally,
  a ComplexAttrPath object that contains information regarding
  the complex path. Handlers look for this object to determine
  if they need to perform extra handling to determine the attribute
  that needs to be updated

0.12.5
------
- Upgrade dependency: scim2-filter-parser -> 0.2.1

0.12.4
------
- Upgrade dependency: scim2-filter-parser -> 0.2.0

0.12.3
------
- Retain capitalization in filter queries
- Add tests

0.12.2
------
- Add AuthorizationError to exceptions

0.12.1
------
- Improve PATCH paths passed into handlers.

  If you have custom handlers for patch calls defined in your adapters file
  (eg. def handle_add(path, value, operation): ...) then you will need to 
  update your handlers to accept a 3-tuple in place of the current string held
  by path. A quick fix for this is to add the following line to the beginning of
  each handler:

      path, subattr, uri = path

  Thanks for your patience as we migrate to a better system for handling PATCH
  paths.

0.12.0
------
- Include schemas in packaged version. Thanks @stefanfoulis!
- Fix #21. Store and return externalId
- Fix #22. Handle more complicated PATH calls
  Please note: the parse_path_and_value method on the SCIMMixin adapter
  changed signature. Please update your code accordingly.

  This commit contains a BREAKING CHANGE.

  If you have overridden the "handle_<op_code>" methods on the User and
  Group adapters, those methods need to be updated to take path, and value
  in addition to operation.

  New adapter signature:

  def handle_<op_code (eg. add)>(self, path, value, operation):
      ...
