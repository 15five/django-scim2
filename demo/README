This app is intended to be an example of how one can override
some of the defaults in django-scim2 to fit your needs.

This app is not meant to be a kitchen sink, showing all options that can
be used or overridden. This is a jumping off point.

This app is also not guaranteed to functional at all times. This demo app
is only supposed to be a loose example of what is possible.
