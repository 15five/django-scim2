django-scim2
============

|tests| |coverage| |docs|

This is a provider-side implementation of the SCIM 2.0 [1]_
specification for use in Django.

Note that currently the only supported database is Postgres.


Installation
------------

Install with pip::

$ pip install django-scim2

Then add the ``django_scim`` app to ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in your Django's settings::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'django_scim',
    )

By default, ``request.user.is_anonymous()`` is checked to determine if the SCIM
request should be allowed or denied.

If you have specific authentication needs, look into overriding the default "is
authenticated predicate" (i.e. see ``GET_IS_AUTHENTICATED_PREDICATE`` for
details) or subclassing the middleware that performs the check
(``AUTH_CHECK_MIDDLEWARE``).

Add the necessary url patterns to your root urls.py file. Please note that the
namespace is mandatory and must be named `scim`::

    urlpatterns = [
        ...
        path('scim/v2/', include('django_scim.urls')),
    ]

Finally, add settings appropriate for you app to your settings.py file::

    SCIM_SERVICE_PROVIDER = {
        'NETLOC': 'localhost',
        'AUTHENTICATION_SCHEMES': [
            {
                'type': 'oauth2',
                'name': 'OAuth 2',
                'description': 'Oauth 2 implemented with bearer token',
            },
        ],
    }

Other SCIM settings can be provided but those listed above are required.

Extensibility
-------------

This library was forked and developed to be highly extensible. A number of
adapters can be defined to control what different endpoints do to your resources.
Please see the documentation for more details.

PLEASE NOTE: This app does not implement authorization and authentication.
Such tasks are left for other apps such as `Django OAuth Toolkit`_ to implement.

Development Speed
-----------------

Since this project is relatively stable, time is only dedicated to it on
Fridays. Thus if you issue a PR, bug, etc, please note that it may take a week
before we get back to you. Thanks you for your patience.
